## General Information
- This is a image classification project.
- we build a convolutional neural network model.
- which classifies the images of different kinds of skin cancers to automate the task of an oncologist.

## Conclusions
- This is most likely a learning project which helps to grasp the concept of CNN and how to deal with various problems while building the model for image classification.

- Here i learned how to improve model performance using dropout layers and class balancing techniques where we can augment the dataset .

## Technologies Used
- Tenserflow - 2.11.0
 - Keras - 2.12.0
 - Augmentor-0.2.12
 - Numpy - 1.22.4
